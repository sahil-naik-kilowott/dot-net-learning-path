## Formulas

### MEAN
The mean is the average of a data set.

in the program first we remove the total of all the elements in the array and then divide it by the length of the array,


## MEDIAN
The median is the middle of the set of numbers. 

Here there are 2 seperate formulas.
If the length of the numbers in the set is even then:-
median= data_set[n/2];

If the length of the numbers in the set is odd then:-
median= (data[(n-1)/2] + data[n/2]) / 2.0;


## MODE
Value or a number that appears most frequently in a data set is a Mode.

in this prog i have taken 2 variables max_num amd max_repeats amd set them to -1;
now we have to keep track how many time a number appears in an array
if the number of its appearances exceeds that of the previous record of apperances, make the num of appearances the new record and make the max_num the new node.
